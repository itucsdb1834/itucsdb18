View For Owner
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Group members will have more permissions for operations at the group, if the owner of the group gives permission to the other members of the group to alter group information. And only the owner of the group is allowed to delete people from group or delete group completely. 

At the figure below, owner of yhe group added a new member to the group. (Since group is private only members of the group can add  people and there is only owner in the group at the begining)
